    <h4>A beautiful young adult dog came into our care in February. Sadly, losing his loving owner and home. Oscar is ready to look for a new home. He will need regular exercise to keep trim and active. However he will not need hours and hours of walks. We hope we can find him the perfect home for his many years ahead as he definitely deserves it.
        He could go with children of primary and secondary school age.</h4>
